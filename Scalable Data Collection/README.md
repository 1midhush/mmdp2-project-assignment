# Multimodal Data Collection

This repository contains minimal setups for collecting and processing datasets in four modalities:
- **Images** (*DiverseImageSet20*)
- **Text** (*NewsText20*)
- **Audio** (*RadioStream30*)
- **Weather** (*IndiaWeatherMonthly*)

## Directory Structure
- `image_data/` : Raw and processed image files along with metadata (CSV).
- `text_data/` : Raw and cleaned text files (one file per category).
- `audio_data/` : Raw and processed audio files along with metadata (CSV).
- `weather_data/` : Weather data in CSV format.
- `notebooks/`  : Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Getting Started
1. Run the provided Python script to generate the directory structure.
2. Populate the folders with your dataset files or use ready-made datasets.
3. Update the notebooks with your EDA and visualization code.

*This minimal structure is designed to help you quickly meet the assignment requirements.*

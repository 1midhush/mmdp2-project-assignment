# Flags and Anthems Analysis Project

This repository contains data and analysis for exploring national flags and anthems.

## Directory Structure

- **flags/**
  - **raw/**: Original images of national flags (at least 100 nations).
  - **processed/**: (Optional) Preprocessed flag images.
- **anthem_text/**
  - **raw/**: Raw English translations of national anthems (from nationalanthems.info).
  - **processed/**: Cleaned text files after pre-processing.
- **anthem_audio/**
  - **raw/**: MP3 files of national anthems (subset of nations).
  - **processed/**: (Optional) Processed audio files or extracted audio features.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and multimodal correlation analysis.

## Tasks

1. **Visual Analysis**: Analyze flag images to extract dominant colors and validate color symbolism.
2. **Textual Analysis**: Pre-process and analyze national anthem texts (e.g., stop word removal, word frequency, sentiment).
3. **Audio Analysis**: Extract features (tempo, spectral centroid, etc.) from anthem MP3 files.
4. **Multimodal Correlation**: Explore correlations between flag colors, anthem text features, and audio characteristics.

*Feel free to expand upon each section with your own analysis and visualizations.*
